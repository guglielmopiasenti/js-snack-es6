# Snack Array Methods

## SNACKS 1

The Great Gatsby asked us to create place cards for the guests' table at his mega VIP party. He left us the name of the table ("VIP Table") and the guest list in order of seating:
[ 'Brad Pitt', 'Johnny Depp', 'Lady Gaga', 'Cristiano Ronaldo', 'Georgina Rodriguez', 'Chiara Ferragni', 'Fedez', 'George Clooney', 'Amal Clooney', 'Maneskin']
But the typography to print everything wants us to send it a list of guests in which each guest is a javascript object which has as attributes: table name, guest name and seat occupied.
We generate and print the placeholder list in the console.

# PROCEDURE

1. I create the array with names.
2. I create the `const` variable "VIP Table".
3. I use the `.map` array method to add information about the seatings.
4. I print it with `console.log` on the console.

## SNACKS 2

We have a list of students of a faculty, identified by id, name and total sum of their exam marks...
To prepare the classroom for a new course, we have to carry out a series of operations

1. We need to create a list of all students who have a total grade above 70
   2.We need to create a list of all students who have total grades above 70 and ids above 120
2. we have to print the plates with the students' names: create a list containing their name in capital letters ES (Marco della Rovere => MARCO DELLA ROVERE);
   This is the list of students:

   Id | Name | Grades
   213 | Marco della Rovere | 78
   110 | Paola Cortellessa | 96
   250 | Andrea Mantegna | 48
   145 | Gaia Borromini | 74
   196 | Luigi Grimaldello | 68
   102 | Piero della Francesca | 50
   120 | Francesca da Polenta | 84

# Procedure

1. I create an array of objects with the given info.
2. I use a `.filter` array method to create a list of all students who have a total grade above 70.
3.
